	// about me
	"aboutme": "Hi... I’m Lonnie Laub and I’m a passionate, creative, adventurous leader.  I have been in the technology and robotics industry for 20+ years and love watching humanity achieve new levels of greatness, efficiency, personal connectivity, and love as a result of the great products I’ve assisted in growing and scaling.  During my tenure in the robotics industry I have learned the ins and outs of what it takes to take an idea from thought to scale and every step in between.  I am a proponent of high-tech companies leading with engineering and am a full stack developer, myself.  When engineering is at the forefront of company vision, the product shines because of what the development team is able to dream of and then create.  I know what it takes to manage a product and I am an extreme proponent for the end user experience and ease of use.  When leading, I always include passion, the human experience, and inspiration as key points to my way of being every day.  I’m confident I can help any start-up build and scale their product.",
